### Hi 👋

My name's Mila (she/her), I'm a PhD student in Neuroscience at McGill University. I'm working on questions to do with the origins of music, using tools from cross-cultural work, developmental psychology, and cross-species comparisons. I'm based at the [Sakata Lab](https://sakatasongbirdlab.wordpress.com/) (McGill University) and the [Peretz Lab](https://peretzlab.ca/) (University of Montreal), and am an affiliated graduate student at [The Music Lab](https://www.themusiclab.org/) (University of Auckland / Yale University).
